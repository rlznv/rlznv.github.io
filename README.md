# rlznv.github.io

a static website i made to host some of my personal projects.

currently, on this website, you'll find:
- [x with the y generator (ptn version)](https://rlznv.github.io/projects/ptn-gen/index.html)

## what's next?

i don't have anything in particular planned. i'll add whatever comes to mind.

possible additions:
- art page/blog
    - timelines, process explanations, progress pics
- building with 11ty
    - if this project's needs outgrows hardcoded html, css, and javascript
